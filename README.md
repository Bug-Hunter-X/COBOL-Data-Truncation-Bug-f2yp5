This repository demonstrates a subtle data truncation bug in a COBOL program. The program calculates a total amount by repeatedly adding a value with decimal places to a field with a fixed number of decimal places. This can lead to inaccurate results due to the truncation of fractional parts.  The solution shows how to modify the program to correctly handle decimal values and avoid data loss.  The `bug.cob` file contains the buggy code, and `bugSolution.cob` provides the corrected version.
